# Rock Paper Scissors project
One of my first ever code projects


### Check it out [Here.](https://terrellv.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/). 

In building this project I used AngularJS Bootstrap and and jquery.

A markov chain has been implimented to allow the computer to predict the user's next move. It tracks the users last two moves and makes a prediction based on past history. It takes a few moves for this to begin implementing as a brief history needs to be stored.
